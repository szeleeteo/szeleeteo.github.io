An excessively elaborate, over-engineered but obligatory, introductory post on a special day. This is the Way.

```python
try:
    raise Exception(
        "0x78,0x78,0x21,0x0a,0x9c,0x21,0x65,"
        "0x64,0x74,0x6C,0x61,0x72,0x72,0x6F,"
        "0x8C,0x57,0x6f,0x20,0x62,0x6F,0x61,"
        "0x6C,0x6c,0x6C,0x1A,0x65,0x65,0x48,0x1A"
    )
except Exception as e:
    from sys import stdout
    _ = stdout.write("".join(map(chr, list(eval(str(e))[-2:2:-2]))))
```
